<h3> ASSIGNMENT NO. 1 DATED 31 AUG,2021 </h3>

1. Write a program to find length of a given string.

2. 2. Write a program to reverse a a given string.

3. Write a program to decide if a string is palindrome or not.

Instruction: Do not use library functions for the above problems.

<h3> ASSIGNMENT NO. 2 DATED 31 AUG,2021 </h3>
Write two programs for finding factorials of a given non-negative integers
a) using a FOR loop
b) using a recursive function

Then test both the programs with different input starting from 10. Observe which one is performing better, and state why.

<h3> ASSIGNMENT NO. 4 DATED 7 SEPT,2021 </h3>
Write a program to check a given string as palindrome by developing a recursive function that takes only two character pointers, pointing to two locations, as argument

<h3> ASSIGNMENT NO. 6 DATED 21 SEPT,2021 </h3>

a) Write a program to multiply two given matrices.

b) Write another program to multiply a chain of matrices. Use a function to multiply two matrices which is to be called from the main.

For the above problem (b), use different order of multiplication for a given chain. Observe which order is comparatively efficient than others.

<h3> ASSIGNMENT NO. 8 DATED 28 OCT,2021 </h3>

1. Explore qsort() function. Use qsort() to sort a set of integers, a set floating point numbers and a set of names (strings) in ascending order by a single program.

2. Design a set of functions (such as ADD, DIV, POWER (to do x^y), etc.) of your choice and store them in an array of function pointers. Write a program that will use these functions from the array, based on the user input. DO NOT USE switch-case/if-else to solve this problem.
